# Clustering Restaurants based on nearby fire-stations in Toronto
This capstone project is done as part of course assignment for Data science Professional certificate specialization by IBM on coursera.org

The data used in this project is obtained from 3 sources Wikipedia, Foursquare API and Open Data portal for city of Toronto.  All these sources are open for public access and can be used for data-science projects. In this project we performed clustering analysis (K-Means algorithm) of the locations of fire-stations in the city of Toronto. We further predicted which restaurant falls in which cluster based on its location. These clusters have uniform number of fire-stations but high skewed number of restaurants. This helped us in uncovering areas where there is a much higher per fire-station load in terms of restaurants. 

**Our study covered 2885 restaurants and 83 fire-stations in the city of Toronto and we found cluster of fire-stations that had as high as 136 restaurants per fire-station which is 4 times the city average.**
